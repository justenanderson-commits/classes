# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

Today was harder for me. I didn't sleep well at all the last two nights and that really impacted my overall energy level. Plus it's a Friday. That make the work much more difficult. That said, I still really enjoyed it. The collaborate nature of Turing content is fun and so is the coding. So I felt a mixture enjoyment and discomfort through most of it.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
It's improving thanks to my increased familiarity with the processes and applications. I'm loving Replit and have learned a many shortcuts in the terminal and MacOs to operate more efficiently. Plus I got my physical workspace dialed in a little better. These improvements have helped me to stay better focused on the tasks at-hand, and therefore have a better understanding of the time they'll take me. I try to have integrity with my wife with how long I tell her I'm going to work on something, and that forces me to be true to myself on my time commitments as well. (i.e. right now I'm on a 30-minute work session before I go pick up dinner.)

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

I need to hone my work environment, get a gym membership, and continue to study between now and then so I can hit the ground running. The ergonomics of my set-up are pretty good, but not quite right and I can start to feel it. That'll have to be fixed. I'm glad that we have some time between Mod 0 and Mod 1.
